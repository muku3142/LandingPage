#LandingPage

##Development
###This project is aimed at designing the navigation menu fora website consisting of multiple sections. It should include some basic features such as:  
###1- Scrolling to the appropriate section 
###2- Highlighting the active section

###Added features:
###1- The navigation button will hide/show the navigation menu upon clicking

####Comments: I was unable to remove the active highlighted section in the navigation menu after finishing hovering, so I used a timer
